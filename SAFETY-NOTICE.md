# 🚨 CRITICAL SAFETY NOTICE

## Database Protection

This package has been designed with **database safety** as a top priority. Here's what you need to know:

### ✅ What We Fixed

1. **Automatic Migration Loading DISABLED**
   - The package no longer automatically loads migrations
   - Your existing database tables are SAFE
   - You have full control over when migrations run

2. **Manual Migration Process**
   - Migrations must be manually published
   - You can review them before running
   - No surprise database changes

3. **Proper Rollback Support**
   - All migrations now have proper `down()` methods
   - Safe rollback capability

### ⚠️ Previous Version Issues

If you experienced database issues with previous versions:

1. **Check your migrations table:**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate:status
   ```

2. **If package migrations were auto-run, you can rollback:**
   ```bash
   # Rollback specific migrations
   php artisan migrate:rollback --step=3
   ```

3. **Restore from backup if needed:**
   - Always restore from your database backup
   - Never rely on rollbacks for critical data

### 🛡️ Safety Measures

1. **Always backup your database before installing packages**
2. **Review published migrations before running them**
3. **Test in development environment first**
4. **Use version control for your project**

### 📋 Safe Installation Process

```bash
# 1. Backup your database first!
mysqldump -u user -p database_name > backup.sql

# 2. Install package
composer require anwar/crud-generator

# 3. Publish assets (migrations will NOT auto-run)
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=crudgenerator-config
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=crudgenerator-migrations
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=crudgenerator-assets

# 4. Review published migrations
ls database/migrations/*anwar*
ls database/migrations/*crudgenerator*

# 5. Only run if safe
php artisan migrate
```

### 🔧 Recovery Steps

If you lost data due to package installation:

1. **Stop the application immediately**
2. **Restore from backup:**
   ```bash
   mysql -u user -p database_name < backup.sql
   ```
3. **Remove the package:**
   ```bash
   composer remove ringkubd/crud-generator
   ```
4. **Reinstall following the safe process above**
